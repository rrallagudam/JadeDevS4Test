    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

I’m excited to share with you that we have replaced our existing Partner portal technology and have launched SFDC Communities effective Monday, January 9th.

The Adaptive Insights Partner Community was designed to improve your partnering experience and will allow you to leverage the same CRM system that our sales team does.

Here are your next steps to gain access:
1. Your user name is {!Receiving_User.Username} and please click here to set your password for the new Partner Community.
2. Login, check it out and let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
3. Register for our Webinar on January 25, 2017 to learn more!

Don’t forget to bookmark the Adaptive Insights Partner Community.

If need any assistance, please connect with us

The Adaptive Insights Channel Team</textOnly>
